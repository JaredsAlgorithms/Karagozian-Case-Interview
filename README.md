# Karagozian-Case-Interview

Coding challenge from Karagozian &amp; Case written in Python

I used Python for this because I can prototype quickly in this language and is not compiled.
I also have access to slicing notation for lists that make more sense and using iterators in a language like Rust or C++ would have been cumbersome.
Using the `zip` function also allows for easier stitching of equal length arrays and can be seen frequently in these solutions.
Lastly, I have some pre-made testing suites I wrote for Tuffix and I thought I would use them here to ensure my code is working.
The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/CSUF-Tuffix/Tuffix-2)
